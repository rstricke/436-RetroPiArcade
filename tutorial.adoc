== Intro

This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating your own Portable RetroPi Console.

== Prerequisites

In order to proceed with this tutorial you will need: 

* a RaspberryPi (I've used a Pi-B+ with this build.) 
* a 5 to 7 inch LCD screen
* a case for the RaspberryPi & a case for the entire build to be mounted into. (includes screen, speaker, battery pack, room for cords, etc.)
* a battery pack (5600mah)
* 6inch HDMI cord
* a heatsink & fan for the RaspberryPi
* HDMI adapter
* An SD card with the RetroPi OS to be able to run games

== Instructions

. Step one.
		
		* The first step that we will need to take, is to insert the SD card into the RaspberryPi.

. Step two.
		
		* The second step is to install the RaspberryPi to its case. 
		For this build, I have gone with an open case where I only have to connect the bottom half of the RaspberryPi to it.
		After the RaspberryPi has been installed to it's case, proceed to install the HeatSink/Fan to the RaspberryPi.

. Step six. 

	* Connect the speaker to the raspberrypi. Glue it in place.
